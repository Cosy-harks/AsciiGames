I have two versions of this three dimensional snake game

1. Three different orthogonal perspective views to look at the three axis separately
	1. Only two of three views are needed to play this version
	2. Use the number pad to control the direction of the snake.
2. The other is an attempt at perspective into a box which is nearly impossible to play
	1. This only has one view.
	2. Numpad controls [ 4, left; 5, down; 6, right; 8, up; 3, deep; 9, surface ] I think.
